Develop a image classification model that can be deloy on a edge devices
Model Development: Developed an image classification model utilizing transfer learning with MobileNetV2.

Model Conversion: Converted the model to TensorFlow Lite format and performed optimization and quantization to reduce size and latency, enabling the model to run efficiently on microcontrollers and embedded devices.

Accuracy Improvement: Enhanced the model's accuracy through quantization-aware training to address the accuracy drop caused by converting float32 weights to int8.
